# Social-Network
## Description

This week's challenge was using a noSQL database to create api routes for a social network. The database that we used was Mongoose's mongoDB. Though very similar to the relational database of mySQL, mongoDB introduces more flexibility by saving data into documents. We also learned the different syntax needed to create, read, update, and delete the routes that we created.

## Installation

To install this application, you need Express.js, MongoDB database, and Mongoose. 

## Usage

This application runs by simply typing ```nodemon run watch``` into the integrated terminal to start the server. User and Thought data will be seeded into the database to begin. Once data has been seeded, you can test your routes using any of the CRUD methods.
